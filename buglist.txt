1)isEmpty() is broken and never updates. isEmpty() returns false 
on a newly created Linked list with no node, but it should return true.

2)size() starts at 1 on an empty LinkedList and increments/decrements
normally. The starting value is 1, but should be 0.

3)addBack() only adds the same value for any subsequent value after the
first node is added via addBack().

4)removeFront() actually removes from the back of the LinkedList.
